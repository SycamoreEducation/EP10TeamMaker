# EP10 Team Maker
Algorithm for creating teams based off of EP10 scores 

## Abstract
The [Fremont Creative Collective](http://www.fremontcreativecollective.org) is starting an initiative to get Gallup's EP10 test taken in every high school in the Fremont area. The EP10 is an assessment created by 10 years of research by Gallup to name and identify 10 top strenghts of entreprenuers. 

For each of the ten strenghts, an individual can be either Supporting (1), Contributing (2) or Dominant (3). The assessment is made up of a series of hypothetical and situation questions that the user will answer in 10 seconds or less. The limit limit is to help the user go with their 'gut' and not over think the questions.

## Goal
The goal of this repo is to create a system for combining a collection of test takers into the most effective groups as possible, as determined by their EP10 scores.

## Requirements
- Code should be able to take a variable number of participants and divide them into a variable number of groups
- The ten EP10 strenghts will be constant and will all have a value or 1, 2 or 3
